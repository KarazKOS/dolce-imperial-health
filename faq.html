                            In order to create your own Sub Agency, Stella Health will require you to complete a General Agency Agreement contract packet. Just like the Career and Independent contract packet. The General Agency Agreement states the ins and outs of the relationship between your Sub Agency and Stella Health. The only difference is instead of receiving an Agent Profile we are going to ask you to fill out an Agency Profile. Again, the Agency Profile asks basic questions like the agency name, phone number, and email address for the sub agency. Also, if you are creating you own sub agency through Stella Health you must obtain your very own Business Entity License and create your own corporation. Now to go further into sub agencies in order to have the ability to create your very own team you must have a minimum of 5 agents within your sub agency including yourself. You must also maintain a minimum production count of 300, this is for a level 1 sub agency. Over time if you would like to grow your team to become a level 2 sub agency, you must have a minimum of 10 agents within your sub agency and maintain a minimum production of 600. As you can see there is plenty of opportunity for growth being an agent here at Stella Health. Exciting stuff, right?
