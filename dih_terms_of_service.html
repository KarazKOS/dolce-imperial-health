Please read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”)and our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) carefully because they govern your use of the website located at askchapter.org (the “Site”); and the Medicare-related advisory, educational and brokerage services, our proprietary questionnaire and recommendation engine, and other ancillary services and information accessible through or in connection with the Site (and any corresponding mobile application (“App”)) offered by Memoir, Inc. (dba Chapter), Chapter Medicare, LLC (“Chapter Agent”), and their affiliates (collectively, “Chapter”). To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, our services (including our questionnaire and recommendation engine) and App are collectively called the “Services.”


IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND CHAPTER THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 17 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION.

2. Privacy Policy.
Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Services, for information on how we collect, use and share your information.

3. Description of Services.
a. Short List. As an initial step in your use of the Services, we may make available to you our proprietary questionnaire with questions designed to help us create a short list of additional Medicare plans available in your area based on your responses (the “Short List”).  At this stage, we will provide the Short List in “masked” form in a manner that does not reveal any plan identifiable characteristics for Medicare Advantage or Part D drug plans, and we will not recommend a specific additional Medicare plan to you.

b. Scope of Appointment. After you complete the questionnaire and receive the Short List, you will be presented with a Scope of Appointment  through the Services. This Scope of Appointment outlines your permission and acknowledgement of the specific types of additional Medicare plans that a licensed insurance agent may discuss with you. By electing to proceed with the Scope of Appointment through the Services, you agree to the terms set forth therein. Once you assent to the Scope of Appointment through the Services, Chapter Agent or another of Chapter’s licensed agents  will be able to provide you with recommendations, guidance, plan identifiable characteristics and other details regarding the additional Medicare plans on the Short List.

Nothing in these Terms is intended to conflict with or limit Chapter’s obligations and requirements under applicable laws, rules or regulations of any federal or state jurisdiction.

‍

5. Changes to these Terms or the Services.
We may update the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site, to the App and/or may also send other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes.

‍

16. Governing Law and Forum Choice.
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 17 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Chapter are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in New York City, New York, and you and Chapter each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

‍

17. Dispute Resolution.
a. Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and Chapter agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Chapter are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.

b. Exceptions. As limited exceptions to Section 17(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.

c. Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.

Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.

d. Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.

e. Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section 17(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.

f. Class Action Waiver. YOUAND CHAPTER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR ORITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.

g. Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 17(f) of these Terms (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Chapter’s prior written consent.
